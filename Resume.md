**Patrick Bilic - Managing Director at Cubemos**
> I had to chance to work with Adrian during our new product
> introduction phase. As an external AR/VR expert he proactively
> supported us with his lead customer mindset. He showed analytical
> skills and understood the relevant success factors. Further, he was
> able to combine it with an unopinionated mindset of a technical expert
> in the field of AR/VR. Further, I want to thank him for his voluntary
> contribution, a showcase of our Skeleton Tracking Middleware. As a
> unity expert he was able to develop a virtual avatar for a video
> showcase to support our marketing efforts.

**Shaun Spalding - Assistant Director at New Media Rights**

> I worked with Adrian in his capacity as a Unity trainer. He always
> took the job very seriously and tried to teach projects that he could
> put his unique take on. He was consistent, reliable, and pleasant to
> work with, so he definitely gets my recommendation.

#### Troy Halsey - CEO at The Halsey Group LLC
> Adrian was a huge help to us on several development products - but

> freelance/contract scenario.
